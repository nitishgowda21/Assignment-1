        Indian agricultural production relies heavily on the application of
        fertilizers. They are by far, the most essential resource in modern
        agriculture.India is the 2nd largest consumer of fertilizers worldwide,
        but the majority of our farmers are uninformed about the diverse options
        available to them,which forces them to count on the shopkeeper’s
        intellect to present them with good fertilizers.
        India ranks third place
        in the world’s overall fertilizer production, second in nitrogen
        fertilizers, and third in phosphate fertilizers. Moreover, about 25% of
        GDP market capitalization is from fertilizers.

      <p id="para2">
       <br> The production status of different fertilizers is in the following
        trends: At present, 57 fertilizer units are manufacturing a wide number
        of nitrogen fertilizers.</br>
        <br>These include 29 urea-producing units and 9
        ammonia sulfate-producing units as a by-product. Besides, there are 64
        small-scale producing units of single super phosphate.</br>
        <br>Considering the
        state-wise trends in production, the top three states which have the
        high installation of production units are Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar-Pradesh. That’s why, in order to fill the void after scrutinizing
        various indicators is putting together a list of the top 15 largest
