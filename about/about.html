        A fertilizer (American English) or fertiliser (British English) is any
        material of natural or synthetic origin that is applied to soil or to
        plant tissues to supply plant nutrients. Fertilizers may be distinct
        from liming materials or other non-nutrient soil amendments. Many
        sources of fertilizer exist, both natural and industrially produced. For
        most modern agricultural practices, fertilization focuses on three main
        macro nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) with
        occasional addition of supplements like rock flour for micronutrients.
        Farmers apply these fertilizers in a variety of ways: through dry or
        pelletized or liquid application processes, using large agricultural
        equipment or hand-tool methods.

        Historically fertilization came from natural or organic sources:
        compost, animal manure, human manure, harvested minerals, crop rotations
        and byproducts of human-nature industries (i.e. fish processing waste,
        or blodwell from animal slaughter). However, starting in the 19th
        century, after innovations in plant nutrition, an agricultural industry
        developed around synthetically created fertilizers. This transition was
        important in transforming the global food system, allowing for
        larger-scale industrial agriculture with large crop yields.

        <br />
        nitrogen-fixing processes like the Haber process, developed in the 20th
        century and expanded during World War II, led to a surge in nitrogen
        fertilizer use. The use of nitrogen fertilizers increased by 800% from
        1961 to 2019, boosting productivity in the "Green Revolution". However,
        this has led to environmental issues like water pollution,
        eutrophication, and emissions from production. Sustainable agriculture
        practices can help mitigate these negative impacts by reducing
        environmental damage caused by industrial agriculture, such as soil
        contamination and pollution.
